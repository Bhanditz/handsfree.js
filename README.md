> A drop-in library for adding face-controlled mouse pointers via computer vision ðŸ™ˆ

## Scripts

### With Yarn...
```bash
yarn init  # To update the package with your own labels
yarn       # and yarn --only=dev if you have a global NODE_ENV=production, the default on Windows.
yarn dev   # Development mode with SASS, templates, and hot-reload on localhost:8080
yarn build # Build the library
```

### ...or with NPM

```bash
npm init       # To update the package with your own labels
npm install    # and npm install --only=dev if you have a global NODE_ENV=production, the default on Windows.
npm run dev    # Development mode with SASS, templates, and hot-reload on localhost:8080
npm run build  # Build the library
```

## Development

The actual library is built with `/src/main.js` as the starting point. When people `npm install handsfree` and `import handsfree from 'handsfree'`, they'll be loading this file.

The `/sandbox/` scripts are used when developing with `yarn dev` and are there to help you in developing your library (`/src/main.js`). Your library and `/sandbox/index.js` are automatically injected into `/sandbox/index.pug`. When you run `yarn build`, these files are included in the `/dist/` folder which allows you to quickly deploy examples with your library!

## Usage

### Config
You can instatiate Handsfree with the following config (defaults are shown):

```js
const handsfree = new Handsfree({
  // Whether to show the debugger or not
  debug: false
})
```

### API

```js
// Starts tracking faces and shows the webcam if debug is on
handsfree.start()
// Stops the webcam
handsfree.stop()
// Toggle between start/stop (null), or explicitly set it to on (true) or off (false)
handsfree.toggle(true|false|null)

// Toggles the debugger on (true), off (false), or flips the state (null)
handsfree.toggleDebugger(true|false|null)
```

### Debugging

The debugger is loaded into the first element in the DOM with the `.handsfree-debug-wrap`. If one doesn't exist, then it's added as the last root element of `body`.

### Plugins
Handsfree is built around a plugin architecture, which allows us to easily add and share functionality. We can even disable them!

To add a plugin, use the `handsfree.use({})` method with the following form:

```js
handsfree.use({
  name: '',
  // Called once when the use method is called and after the plugin is added to the instance
  onUse: () => {},
  // Called once per frame, after calculations, along with the detected face object
  onFrame: face => {}
})
```

## Events
### handsfree-trackFaces
An alternative to plugins is to use listen in on the window `handsfree-trackFaces` event:

```js
/**
 * Bind to the handsfree-trackFaces event
 * @param {Handsfree} ev.detail.scope The handsfree instance
 * @param {Object}    ev.detail.faces An array of face objects
 */
window.addEventListener('handsfree-trackFaces', (ev) => {
  // Do code with the handsfree instance: ev.detail.scope
  // or with the faces ev.detail.faces.forEach(face => {})
})
```

### handsfree-injectDebugger
The `handsfree-injectDebugger` event is fired after the debugger is injected, but before handsfree is started. Use this event to draw into the canvas without the camera being turned one.

```js
/**
 * Bind to the handsfree-injectDebugger event
 * @param {Handsfree}       ev.detail.scope The handsfree instance
 * @param {Canvas2DContent} ev.detail.canvasContext The 2D debug canvas context
 */
window.addEventListener('handsfree-injectDebugger', (ev) => {
  // Do code with the handsfree instance: ev.detail.scope
  // or draw into the canvas with ev.detail.canvasContext
})
```

## Classes
The document body contains `.handsfree-stopped` when handsfree is stopped (this includes when it's been initialized but not started), and `.handsfree-started` when it's on. This lets you style any page on the page!
